## Chapter 1: Intro to OOP in C#

### What are Classes and Objects?

- A class is a template for objects

- An object is an instance of a class. When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class.


### What are the basic concepts of OOP?

- The four basic concepts of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) are:
    - [Encapsulation](#what-is-encapsulation)
    - [Abstraction](#what-is-abstraction)
    - [Inheritance](#what-is-inheritance)
    - [Polymorphism](#what-is-polymorphism)

### What is Encapsulation?

- Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

- One way to think about encapsulation is as a protective wrapper that prevents the code and data from being arbitrarily accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper.

### What is Abstraction?

- Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information.

- The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the user and showing only the required features of an object.

### What is Inheritance?

- Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.

- The class that inherits the features of another class is called the subclass, and the class whose features are inherited is called the superclass.

### What is Polymorphism?

- Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms.

- Polymorphism is a feature of OOP that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.

### What are the benefits of OOP?

- The benefits of OOP are:
    - Reusability
    - Data Redundancy
    - Code Maintenance
    - Security
    - Design Benefits
    - Better Productivity
    - Easy Troubleshooting
    - Polymorphism Flexibility
    - Problems Solving
